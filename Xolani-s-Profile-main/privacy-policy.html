                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>1. Access and eligibility</h2>

You agree to take full responsibility for your selection and use of the Subscription Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access or use the Subscription Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
                  <p>Xolani Tambani may change, modify, suspend or discontinue the Subscription Services, fees, charges, terms at its own discretion at any time, including the availability of any feature or content. Xolani Tambani may also impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or all of the Subscription Services without notice or liability.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <h2>2. Subscription Services</h2>

We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Subscription Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
                  <p>You can choose between a quarterly or yearly subscription to Subscription Services. When you purchase your selected Directory Membership, you will have access to any Subscription Service item or content currently available within that Directory Membership for the period you have chosen for your Directory Membership. We may decide to periodically update the Subscription Services features, software and/or content made available in the Directory Membership, and some Subscription Services features, software and/or content may either become unavailable or be made available for free when this happens.</p>
                  <h2>3. Using the Subscription Services</h2>
                  <p>TThe Subscription Service and any feature, software or content that is made available through the Subscription Service (the “Content”) are the property of Xolani Tambani , Xolani&#x27;s licensors or third parties.
